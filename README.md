#  C - Binary tree ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²


## Description

This is C project about Binary Trees, BST data structures. 

## Learning Objectives

* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Usage

* All files were compiled using ` gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic ` 
* All files were linted for syntax and style with [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty)
